        summary: `Mushrooms  have  been  used  as 
        functional  foods,  nutraceuticals  and  medicines  for 
        decades in Asian countries. Because of their vital roles 
        in  human  health, nutrition,  and  well-being,  they are 
        described as treasures in the wild and have served as 
        food  supplements.  In  regard  to  their  nutritional 
        composition,  they  are  relatively  low  in  total  fat, 
        vitamins, minerals, and ﬁber, but rich in high quality 
        proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids.`,
